# Lapis
A Roblox DataStore abstraction that offers:
- Caching
- Session locking
- Validation (rejects incorrect data)
- Migrations
- Retries
- Throttling
- Promise based API
- Immutability

This library was inspired by [Quicksave](https://github.com/evaera/Quicksave).

## Warning
Lapis has not been battle-tested in a large production game yet. It may contain obscure bugs so use at your own risk.
